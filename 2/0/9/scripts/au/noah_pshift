/* noah_pshift
 * -----------
 * Perform pure shift processing on NOAH PSYCHE module, i.e. extract the 1D FID
 * from the 2D interferogram. This is a heavily simplified/rewritten version of
 * the `pshift` AU programme in TopSpin. The major difference is that the drop
 * points are read from cnst22 instead of cnst4 as usual (in NOAH supersequences,
 * cnst4 is reserved for 1J(NH) in 15N modules).

/* The GRPDLY parameter tells us how much to circularly shift the FID by (i.e.
 * take points from the start and move them to the end; and then apply a
 * first-order phase correction). The formula is as such. The number of points
 * to be cut is floor(GRPDLY), and the 1st order phase correction to be applied
 * is (GRPDLY - floor(GRPDLY)) * 360. However, in practice, the phase correction
 * is quite small and so can be left to apk to deal with.
 * Here we cut a ton of code that was to do with not being able to read GRPDLY
 * on older spectrometers (I don't know *how* old). It basically involves
 * reading the parameters DECIM and DSPFVS, then performing a lookup in a list,
 * which is provided at the bottom of the original pshift script. I don't know
 * if it's worth (re-)implementing this.
