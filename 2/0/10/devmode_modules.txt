Module codes
============


H-C HMBC
--------

C_HMBC_CF
    zz-HMBC, as described in doi:10.1039/C8CC03296C, with second-order low-pass
    J filter.
C_HMBC_CFTO
    Same as above but with a third-order low-pass J filter. Generally should
    not be needed.
C_HMBC_CFG
    An experimental version -- this does not work and is not likely to ever
    work! Use at your own risk!
C_HMBC_CNF
    Semi-adiabatic double filter which preserves CH and NH magnetisation, as
    described in doi:10.1016/j.jmr.2019.106568.
C_HMBC_NOF
    HMBC without the zz-filter. Note that this is not the same as the Bruker
    `hmbcetgp..` experiments: the gradient scheme here is symmetric, whereas
    the Bruker experiments have an asymmetric gradient scheme.


H-N experiments
---------------

N_HMQC
    Standard HMQC, similar to that originally reported in
    doi:10.1002/anie.201705506, but gradient scheme has been slightly modified
    to reduce artefacts in later modules.
N_HSQC
    Standard NOAH HSQC. Not recommended for use as this causes f1 broadening in
    all subsequent modules, see doi:10.1016/j.jmr.2021.107027 for explanation.
N_SEHSQC
    NOAH seHSQC, 'version 2' / 'ZIP-seHSQC', as described in
    doi:10.1016/j.jmr.2021.107027.
N_SEHSQC_DP
    NOAH seHSQC, 'version 1', as described in doi:10.1016/j.jmr.2021.107027.
    Not recommended for use as this causes f1 broadening in all subsequent
    modules.
N_SEHSQC_OR
    Cavanagh-Rance seHSQC, essentially the same as `hsqcetf3gpsi`.


H-C HSQCs
---------

C_HSQC
    Standard NOAH HSQC.
C_HSQC_F2J
    Standard NOAH HSQC, but without 13C decoupling during acquisition. There is
    a 90° pulse on 13C before acquisition, which purges antiphase contributions
    to peaks (i.e. 'CLIP' version).
C_SEHSQC
    NOAH seHSQC, 'version 2' / 'ZIP-seHSQC' as reported in
    doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.0c05205 and doi:10.1016/j.jmr.2021.107027.
C_SEHSQC_F2J
    Same as C_SEHSQC but without 13C decoupling during acquitision.
C_SEHSQC_DP
    NOAH seHSQC, 'version 1' as reported in doi:10.1016/j.jmr.2021.107027.
    Sensitivity is not as good as in 'version 2', hence this is never
    recommended by default. However, this could be better in specific scenarios
    as bulk magnetisation is more uniformly preserved over the entire spectral
    window, where 'version 2' has some regions where performance is quite
    poorer than average.
C_SEHSQC_OR
    Cavanagh-Rance seHSQC, essentially a mixture of `hsqcetgpsisp2.2` (for the
    non-edited) and `hsqcedetgpsisp2.3` (for the edited).
CI_HSQC
    Standard NOAH HSQC, but with an additional variable `cnst32` which allows
    the user to control the amount of C-H magnetisation excited by the INEPT
    block. Any unexcited magnetisation is returned to +z for use in other
    modules. See doi:10.1016/j.jmr.2021.107027.
CI_HSQC_F2J
    Same as C_HSQC_F2J, but is `cnst32`-compatible.


Other H-C experiments
---------------------

C_HSQC_COSY
    'Triple spin echo' version of HSQC-COSY experiment.  Lineshapes are not so
    good and raw sensitivity is not as high as in the other alternatives, but
    this module does preserve uncoupled 1H ('bulk') magnetisation for later use
    (none of the other HSQC-COSY versions do).
C_HSQC_COSY_CLIP
    CLIP-HSQC-COSY as reported in doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.0c04124. This
    provides excellent lineshapes but dephases bulk magnetisation.
C_HSQC_COSY_DSE
    'Double spin echo' version of HSQC-COSY experiment.  Lineshapes are not so
    good and bulk magnetisation is also dephased, but this has the greatest raw
    sensitivity of all the HSQC-COSY versions.
C_HSQC_TOCSY
    Standard NOAH HSQC with a TOCSY mixing block, as reported in
    doi:10.1016/j.jmr.2021.107027. This preserves bulk magnetisation.
C_SEHSQC_TOCSY
    NOAH seHSQC, 'version 2' / 'ZIP-seHSQC' with a TOCSY mixing lock, as
    reported in doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.0c05205. This also preserves bulk
    magnetisation.
C_SEHSQC_TOCSY_OR
    Cavanagh-Rance seHSQC with TOCSY mixing block, basically the same as Bruker
    `hsqcdietgpsisp.2` and `hsqcdiedetgpsisp.3`.  This doesn't preserve bulk
    magnetisation.
CI_HSQC_COSY
    Same as C_HSQC_COSY, but is `cnst32`-compatible.
CI_HSQC_COSY_CLIP
    Same as C_HSQC_COSY_CLIP, but has an additional variable `cnst32` which
    changes the INEPT delay durations. This is NOT the same as
    "cnst32-compatible", because even though only a portion of the C-H
    magnetisation is excited, the unexcited portion is not retained, it is lost
    by gradient dephasing! This module serves little purpose except to prove
    that it doesn't work.
CI_HSQC_COSY_DSE
    Same as C_HSQC_COSY_DSE, but has an additional variable `cnst32` which
    changes the INEPT delay durations. This is NOT "cnst32-compatible", see
    above for explanation.
CI_HSQC_TOCSY
    Same as C_HSQC_TOCSY, but is `cnst32`-compatible.


H-H experiments
---------------

H_CLIP_COSY
    CLIP-COSY as reported in doi:10.1002/anie.201510938.
H_COSY
    Standard echo-antiecho COSY, similar to Bruker `cosyetgp`.
H_COSY_NOESY
    Echo-antiecho COCONOSY module (COSY and NOESY, with COSY FID recorded
    during the NOE mixing time), as reported in doi:10.1002/anie.201705506.
H_COSY_NOESY_ST
    States COCONOSY module: this is better for low-viscosity samples (e.g.
    CDCl3) as diffusion during the mixing time can cause substantial
    sensitivity losses in the echo-antiecho version.
H_COSY_QF
    Standard magnitude-mode COSY, similar to Bruker `cosygpqf`.
H_COSY_ROESY_ST
    States COSY + ROESY. The COSY FID is recorded before the ROESY mixing
    begins.
H_COSY_TOCSY
    Echo-antiecho COSY + TOCSY. The COSY FID is recorded before the TOCSY
    mixing begins. This is similar to the 'COTO' sequence presented in
    doi:10.1002/mrc.4835.
H_COSY_TOCSY_ST
    States COSY + TOCSY.
H_DQF_COSY
    States DQF-COSY.
H_DQF_COSY_EA
    Echo-antiecho DQF-COSY.
H_JRES
    Magnitude-mode 2D J-resolved spectrum.
H_NOESY
    Standard States NOESY, similar to `noesygpphzs`.
H_PSYCHE
    1D PSYCHE as reported in doi:10.1002/anie.201404111.
H_PSYCHE_JRES
    Absorption-mode 2D J-resolved spectrum, using the PSYCHE element, as
    reported in doi:10.1039/c5cc06293d.
H_ROESY
    ROESY with 180/-180 spin-lock as the mixing element; similar to Bruker
    `roesyetgp.2`.
H_ROESY_AD
    ROESY with adiabatic spin-lock, as reported in doi:10.1002/chem.200802027.
H_TOCSY
    Standard States TOCSY, similar to `dipsi2gpphzs`.
H_TSE_PSYCHE
    1D TSE-PSYCHE as reported in doi:10.1039/c5cc06293d. This provides much
    better artefact suppression compared to the original PSYCHE method.


Modules specific to time-shared / interleaved work
--------------------------------------------------

C_HMBC_CFDD
    Two interleaved zz-HMBC with 13C filter only (so C_HMBC_CF), but with two
    different delays for nJ(CH) evolution. The resulting pair of HMBCs have
    half resolution in the indirect dimension.
C_HMBC_CF_K
    zz-HMBC (C_HMBC_CF) with half the resolution in the indirect dimension and
    twice the number of scans, so-named because it corresponds to a value of
    k = 2 in the k-scaling discussed in doi:10.1016/j.jmr.2021.107027.
C_HSQC_F2J_K
    Same as C_HSQC_F2J but with k = 2, i.e. half resolution in indirect
    dimension but twice the number of scans.
C_SEHSQC_F2J_K
    Same as C_SEHSQC_F2J but with k = 2, i.e. half resolution in indirect
    dimension but twice the number of scans.

    Interleaved in-phase and antiphase F2-coupled seHSQC (version 2 / ZIP).

    refer to the relative phase of the HSQC-COSY, i.e. indirect, peaks and the
    HSQC, i.e. direct, peaks. When added or subtracted these will yield either
    only the direct peaks or only the indirect peaks.
C_HSQC_COSY_CLIP_IA
