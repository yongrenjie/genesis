Module codes
============


H-C HMBC
--------

C_HMBC_CF      zz-HMBC, as described in doi:10.1039/C8CC03296C, with
               second-order low-pass J filter.
C_HMBC_CFTO    Same as above but with a third-order low-pass J filter. Generally
               should not be needed.
C_HMBC_CFG     An experimental version -- this does not work as of now. Use at
               own risk.
C_HMBC_CNF     Semi-adiabatic double filter which preserves CH and NH
               magnetisation, as described in doi:10.1016/j.jmr.2019.106568.
C_HMBC_NOF     HMBC without the zz-filter. Note that this is not the same as the
               Bruker `hmbcetgp..` experiments: the gradient scheme here is
               symmetric, whereas the Bruker experiments have an asymmetric
               gradient scheme.


H-N experiments
---------------

N_HMQC         Standard HMQC, similar to that originally reported in
               doi:10.1002/anie.201705506, but gradient scheme has been slightly
               modified to reduce artefacts in later modules.
N_HSQC         Standard NOAH HSQC. Not recommended for use as this causes f1
               broadening in all subsequent modules.
N_SEHSQC       NOAH seHSQC, 'version 2' / 'ZIP-seHSQC' (manuscript submitted).
N_SEHSQC_DP    NOAH seHSQC, 'version 1' (manuscript submitted). Not recommended
               for use as this causes f1 broadening in all subsequent modules.
N_SEHSQC_OR    Cavanagh-Rance seHSQC, essentially the same as `hsqcetf3gpsi`.


H-C HSQCs
---------

C_HSQC         Standard NOAH HSQC.
C_HSQC_F2J     Standard NOAH HSQC, but without 13C decoupling during
               acquisition. There is a 90Â° pulse on 13C before acquisition,
               which purges antiphase contributions to peaks (i.e. 'CLIP'
               version).
C_SEHSQC       NOAH seHSQC, 'version 2' / 'ZIP-seHSQC' as reported in
               doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.0c05205.
C_SEHSQC_DP    NOAH seHSQC, 'version 1' (manuscript submitted). Sensitivity is
               not as good as in 'version 2', hence this is never recommended by
               default.
C_SEHSQC_OR    Cavanagh-Rance seHSQC, essentially a mixture of
               `hsqcetgpsisp2.2` and `hsqcedetgpsisp2.3`.
CI_HSQC        Standard NOAH HSQC, but with an additional variable `cnst32`
               which allows the user to control the amount of C-H magnetisation
               excited by the INEPT block. Any unexcited magnetisation is
               returned to +z for use in other modules (manuscript submitted).
CI_HSQC_F2J    Same as C_HSQC_F2J, but is `cnst32`-compatible.


Other H-C experiments
---------------------

C_HSQC_COSY         'Triple spin echo' version of HSQC-COSY experiment.
                    Lineshapes are not so good and raw sensitivity is not as
                    high as in the other alternatives, but this module does
                    preserve uncoupled 1H ('bulk') magnetisation for later use
                    (none of the other HSQC-COSY versions do).
C_HSQC_COSY_CLIP    CLIP-HSQC-COSY as reported in
                    doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.0c04124. This provides excellent
                    lineshapes but dephases bulk magnetisation.
C_HSQC_COSY_DSE     'Double spin echo' version of HSQC-COSY experiment.
                    Lineshapes are not so good and bulk magnetisation is also
                    dephased, but this has the greatest raw sensitivity of all
                    the HSQC-COSY versions.
C_HSQC_TOCSY        Standard NOAH HSQC with a TOCSY mixing block (manuscript
                    submitted). This preserves bulk magnetisation.
C_SEHSQC_TOCSY      NOAH seHSQC, 'version 2' / 'ZIP-seHSQC' with a TOCSY mixing
                    lock, as reported in doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.0c05205.
C_SEHSQC_TOCSY_OR   Cavanagh-Rance seHSQC with TOCSY mixing block, basically the
                    same as Bruker `hsqcdietgpsisp.2` and `hsqcdiedetgpsisp.3`.
CI_HSQC_COSY        Same as C_HSQC_COSY, but is `cnst32`-compatible.
CI_HSQC_COSY_CLIP   Same as C_HSQC_COSY_CLIP, but has an additional variable
                    `cnst32` which changes the INEPT delay durations. This is
                    NOT the same as "cnst32-compatible", because even though
                    only a portion of the C-H magnetisation is excited, the
                    unexcited portion is not retained, it is lost by gradient
                    dephasing! This module serves little purpose except to prove
                    that it doesn't work.
CI_HSQC_COSY_DSE    Same as C_HSQC_COSY_DSE, but has an additional variable
                    `cnst32` which changes the INEPT delay durations. This is
                    NOT "cnst32-compatible", see above for explanation.
CI_HSQC_TOCSY       Same as C_HSQC_TOCSY, but is `cnst32`-compatible.


H-H experiments
---------------

H_CLIP_COSY       CLIP-COSY as reported in doi:10.1002/anie.201510938.
H_COSY            Standard echo-antiecho COSY, similar to Bruker `cosyetgp`.
H_COSY_NOESY      Echo-antiecho COCONOSY module (COSY and NOESY, with COSY FID
                  recorded during the NOE mixing time), as reported in
                  doi:10.1002/anie.201705506.
H_COSY_NOESY_ST   States COCONOSY module: this is better for low-viscosity
                  samples (e.g. CDCl3) as diffusion during the mixing time can
                  cause substantial sensitivity losses in the echo-antiecho
                  version.
H_COSY_QF         Standard magnitude-mode COSY, similar to Bruker `cosygpqf`.
H_COSY_ROESY_ST   States COSY + ROESY. The COSY FID is recorded before the ROESY
                  mixing begins.
H_COSY_TOCSY      Echo-antiecho COSY + TOCSY. The COSY FID is recorded before
                  the TOCSY mixing begins. This is similar to the 'COTO'
                  sequence presented in doi:10.1002/mrc.4835.
H_COSY_TOCSY_ST   States COSY + TOCSY.
H_DQF_COSY        States DQF-COSY.
H_DQF_COSY_EA     Echo-antiecho DQF-COSY.
H_JRES            Magnitude-mode 2D J-resolved spectrum.
H_NOESY           Standard States NOESY, similar to `noesygpphzs`.
H_PSYCHE          1D PSYCHE as reported in doi:10.1002/anie.201404111.
H_PSYCHE_JRES     Absorption-mode 2D J-resolved spectrum, using the PSYCHE
                  element, as reported in doi:10.1039/c5cc06293d.
H_ROESY           ROESY with 180/-180 spin-lock as the mixing element; similar
                  to Bruker `roesyetgp.2`.
H_ROESY_AD        ROESY with adiabatic spin-lock, as reported in
                  doi:10.1002/chem.200802027.
H_TOCSY           Standard States TOCSY, similar to `dipsi2gpphzs`.
H_TSE_PSYCHE      1D TSE-PSYCHE as reported in doi:10.1039/c5cc06293d. This
                  provides much better artefact suppression compared to the
                  original PSYCHE method.
